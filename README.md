Canvas and context (2d or 3d) connect to a set of apis and methods that are used for drawing to the canvas.

Think Microsoft paint - how it allows you to drag out shapes, change color, etc.

beginPath(); is like putting the marker down on paper, it starts the drawing. Look it up on MDN Docs

To randomize where the drawing starts on our etch canvas, we randomize a number between the width and height of the drawing area.
